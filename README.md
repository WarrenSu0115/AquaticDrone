# Project AquaticDrone by Warren Su

This is a project dedicated to recreate a simple ecosystem in the nature.

The mission of this project was to form a group of aquatic drones that could interact with each other, receive stimulus from the environment, and change their behaviors accordingly.

As of August 2016, I successfully managed to build a working prototype. The prototype implemented a tiny part of this enthralling concept. The 3D drawings, Arduino code, and components are all provided on this page.

The development of this project had stopped as I immediately became broke just after building the first prototype. Finally, you should view on the demo video on YouTube as it is quite fascinating. I hope someone can use my example as a start to create something even greater!

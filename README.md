Project AquaticDrone: a project dedicated to recreate a simple ecosystem in nature.

The mission of this project was to form a group of aquatic drones that could interact with each other, receive stimulus from the environment, and change their behaviors accordingly.

As of August 2017, I successfully managed to build a working prototype. The prototype implemented a tiny part of this enthralling concept. The 3D drawings, Arduino code, and components are all provided on this page.

The development of this project had stopped as I became broke just after building the first prototype. You should view the demo video on YouTube as it is quite fascinating. Finally, I hope someone can use my example as a start to create something even greater!
